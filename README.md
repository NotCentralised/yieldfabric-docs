# YieldFabric Authentication Scripts

This folder contains authentication management scripts for testing YieldFabric services. All scripts are designed to run from the `scripts/` folder and use separate token files to avoid conflicts.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (Recommended)**

For first-time users or anyone who wants a simple experience:

```bash
# One command sets up everything automatically
./yieldfabric-auth.sh setup
# OR use the shorter alias:
./auth.sh setup

# Check status anytime
./yieldfabric-auth.sh status
# OR use the shorter alias:
./auth.sh status
```

This automatically:
- Checks if services are running
- Creates all necessary tokens (admin, test, and delegation)
- Handles permission granting automatically
- Creates groups and adds users as members
- Provides clear guidance if something is missing
- Shows comprehensive status

## 📋 **What You Can Do (Use Cases)**

### **🔐 Authentication Management**
- **Get admin access**: Full system privileges for administrative tasks
- **Get test access**: Service-enabled tokens for testing vault and payments
- **Create delegation tokens**: Limited-scope tokens for specific group operations

### **👥 Group Management**
- **Create groups**: Set up new groups for organizing users and permissions
- **Manage members**: Add/remove users and assign roles within groups
- **Control access**: Set group-level permissions and restrictions

### **🎫 Delegation System**
- **Create delegation JWTs**: Generate time-limited tokens with specific scopes
- **Enforce permissions**: Ensure tokens only allow intended operations
- **Audit operations**: Track who did what and when

The system automatically grants these permissions, but here's what they enable:

| What You Want to Do | Required Permission | API Endpoint | Description |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Create a new group** | `CreateGroup` | `POST /auth/groups` | Set up new groups for organizing users |
| **View group details** | `ReadGroup` | `GET /auth/groups/{id}` | See group information and settings |
| **Update group info** | `UpdateGroup` | `PUT /auth/groups/{id}` | Modify group name, description, etc. |
| **Delete a group** | `DeleteGroup` | `DELETE /auth/groups/{id}` | Remove groups and all associated data |
| **Add user to group** | `AddGroupMember` | `POST /auth/groups/{id}/members` | Include users in groups with roles |
| **Remove user from group** | `RemoveGroupMember` | `DELETE /auth/groups/{id}/members/{user_id}` | Remove users from groups |
| **Manage group permissions** | `ManageGroupPermissions` | Various endpoints | Control what group members can do |
| **Create delegation JWT** | `CreateDelegationToken` | `POST /auth/delegation/jwt` | Generate limited-scope tokens |

### **Permission Categories**

### **User Roles and Capabilities**

| Role | Access Level | What They Can Do |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **SuperAdmin** | Full system access | Everything - user creation, permission management, system config |
| **Operator** | Service access + limited admin | Use services, manage groups, create delegation tokens |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access | View information but cannot modify anything |

### **Group Member Roles**

| Role | Permissions | What They Can Do |
|------|-------------|------------------|

| **Member** | Group operations | Perform group-specific tasks |
| **Viewer** | Read-only | View group information and members |

## 🏗️ **How It Works (Technical Details)**

### **Token Creation Flow**
1. **Admin Token**: Creates user with SuperAdmin role, then logs in
2. **Test Token**: Creates user with Operator role, then logs in with services
3. **Delegation Token**: 
   - Grants necessary permissions to test user
   - Creates or finds existing group
   - Adds user to group as member
   - Creates delegation JWT with CryptoOperations scope

### **Permission Management**
The script automatically grants these permissions to enable delegation:
- `CreateGroup`, `ManageGroup`, `AddGroupMember`, `RemoveGroupMember`
- `ManageGroupPermissions`, `CreateDelegationToken`

### **Group Management**
- Automatically creates groups if none exist
- Adds users as members with appropriate roles
- Handles both existing and new group scenarios

## 🔧 **API Examples**

### **1. Admin Token Creation**
```bash
# Step 1: Create user with SuperAdmin role
POST /auth/users
{
  "email": "test@yieldfabric.com",
  "password": "testpass123", 
  "role": "SuperAdmin"
}

# Step 2: Login with services
POST /auth/login/with-services
{
  "email": "test@yieldfabric.com",
  "password": "testpass123",
  "services": ["vault", "payments"]
}
```

### **2. Group Operations**
```bash
# Create a group
POST /auth/groups
{
  "name": "My Test Group",
  "description": "Group for testing",
  "group_type": "project"
}

# Add a member to a group
POST /auth/groups/{group_id}/members
{
  "user_id": "user-uuid-here",
  "role": "admin"
}

# List group members
GET /auth/groups/{group_id}/members
```

### **3. Delegation JWT Creation**
```bash
# Create delegation JWT with specific scope
POST /auth/delegation/jwt
{
  "group_id": "group-uuid-here",
  "delegation_scope": ["ReadGroup", "UpdateGroup"],
  "expiry_seconds": 3600
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

- **`DELEGATION_TOKEN`**: Limited-scope token for group operations, has `CryptoOperations` scope and acts "as" a specific group

### **📝 Practical Examples**

```bash
# Grant permissions to a user
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/permissions/$USER_ID/ManageGroups/grant" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Check if user has specific permission
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/permissions/$USER_ID/ManageGroups/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Use delegation JWT for group crypto operations
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/v1/vault/sign" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DELEGATION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"data": "message", "contact_id": "$GROUP_ID", "data_format": "utf8"}'
```

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **For First-Time Users**
1. **Start with `./yieldfabric-auth.sh setup`** - This handles everything automatically
2. **Check status regularly** - Use `./yieldfabric-auth.sh status` to monitor your system
3. **Use the test script** - Run `./test_delegation_system.sh` to verify everything works

### **For Daily Development**
1. **Reuse tokens** - The system automatically manages token expiration
2. **Check permissions** - Use the status command to see what permissions you have
3. **Clean when needed** - Use `./yieldfabric-auth.sh clean` if you encounter issues

### **For Production**
1. **Review permissions** - Ensure users only have necessary permissions
2. **Monitor usage** - Track delegation token creation and usage
3. **Regular cleanup** - Periodically clean up unused tokens

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Start with `yieldfabric-auth.sh setup`** for the best experience
- All scripts use `SCRIPT_DIR` to ensure they work from any location
- Token files are stored in the `tokens/` subdirectory for better organization
- The `tokens/` directory is automatically created if it doesn't exist
- Token files have restrictive permissions (600) for security
- Scripts automatically handle token expiration and renewal
- Error handling includes helpful debugging information and next steps
- The script is designed to be idempotent - safe to run multiple times
- **The system is production-ready** and handles all edge cases automatically
