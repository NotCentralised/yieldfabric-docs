## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**First Australian Demonstration of Confidential Smart Contract-Enabled Structured Finance Transaction**

NotCentralised, in collaboration with Australian Bond Exchange, Perpetual Trustees, IQEQ Trustees, and Redbelly Blockchain, has successfully demonstrated the first Australian tokenised structured finance transaction combining confidential smart contract execution, atomic settlement, and zero-knowledge auditability on a public blockchain.

The demonstration, conducted as part of Project Acacia (the Reserve Bank of Australia's research initiative exploring tokenised assets and digital money in wholesale financial markets), executed a securitisation-style structure involving collateralised loans. The use case tokenised the full lifecycle of capital flows—from investor funding through credit deployment, collateral management, and loan repayment—demonstrating how transactions are settled directly between parties using atomic swaps, enabling capital deployment and repayment to be executed deterministically using smart contracts rather than discretionary operational processes.

The transaction incorporated smart contract–controlled accounts, tokenised credit facilities with cryptographically enforced investment rights, and confidential atomic settlement. All transactions throughout the structured finance lifecycle—investor funding, credit deployment, collateral binding, loan origination, and repayment—were executed through atomic swaps that enable direct settlement between parties, eliminating intermediaries from the settlement process. Zero-knowledge proofs preserved transactional privacy while enabling verification of correctness and compliance on a public blockchain.

The demonstration shows how direct settlement between parties can streamline structured finance workflows while preserving the legal frameworks and fiduciary roles that underpin institutional finance. By eliminating intermediaries from the transaction flow, the approach demonstrates how cryptographic enforcement can reduce operational friction and improve settlement certainty.

**Key Innovations Demonstrated**

The transaction achieved several first-of-kind innovations in the Australian market:

1. **First Atomic and Confidential Multi-Party Transaction**: The demonstration achieved the first implementation of an atomic and confidential multi-party transaction, where three or more parties (investor, issuer, collateral holder, borrower) execute complex financial flows in a single atomic swap. All transaction legs execute simultaneously or none do, with full confidentiality preserved through zero-knowledge proofs, eliminating settlement and counterparty risk while maintaining transactional privacy. This represents the first practical implementation of confidential atomic multi-party settlement for structured finance.

2. **Smart Contract–Controlled Accounts (Intelligent Accounts)**: The structure deployed accounts whose behaviour is embedded directly within smart contract logic, enabling control over assets through deterministic rules rather than discretionary instructions or manual approval processes. Token ownership confers specific cryptographic rights that are enforced programmatically.

3. **Tokenised Credit Facilities and Rights**: Investment Tokens, Credit Facility Tokens, and Collateral Tokens were used to represent and enforce economic rights and control permissions cryptographically. These tokens enable investor withdrawal rights, credit line access, and collateral control to be executed deterministically through atomic swaps, without requiring issuer approval, intermediaries, or off-chain coordination.

4. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration**: Zero-knowledge proofs were integrated throughout the transaction lifecycle, preserving transactional privacy while enabling verification of correctness, compliance, and auditability. This allows sensitive financial data to remain confidential while supporting regulatory review and third-party audit through cryptographic proofs.

**Benefits for the Financial Ecosystem**

The innovations demonstrated have significant implications for structured finance and capital markets:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Deterministic execution of capital deployment, credit utilisation, and repayment flows eliminates manual processes, reconciliation, and discretionary approvals, materially reducing operational costs, latency, and risk while improving resilience.

- **Enhanced Settlement Certainty**: Atomic settlement ensures simultaneous execution of all transaction legs directly between parties or none, eliminating settlement risk, counterparty exposure, and intermediary dependencies with greater finality than traditional sequential processes.

- **Improved Transparency and Auditability**: Continuous verification of transaction state and compliance without full data disclosure enables regulators, auditors, and rating agencies to verify correctness using cryptographic proofs, supporting more efficient surveillance.

- **Preserved Role Separation**: Maintains appropriate separation of roles (investor, issuer, collateral holder, borrower) with streamlined workflows, ensuring custody, control, and economic exposure remain properly allocated without commingling assets.

The use case demonstrates how tokenisation can be applied to execution mechanics of structured finance, enabling pathways to reduce operational friction, improve settlement finality, and maintain appropriate separation of roles—all while supporting confidentiality and third-party auditability. By settling all transactions directly between parties through atomic swaps, the approach eliminates intermediaries from the settlement process, reducing operational complexity and latency. The approach does not seek to replace legal frameworks but instead reduces the operational frequency with which legal recourse is required, enabling financial institutions to operate more efficiently while preserving the legal, regulatory, and economic foundations that support institutional finance.

Project Acacia is a joint initiative between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, exploring how tokenised assets and digital money may complement existing market infrastructure.
