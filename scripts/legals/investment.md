Structured investment opportunity for Australian wholesale investors that combines invoice factoring, collateralised credit, and managed capital deployment within the YieldFabric platform. Capitalised terms used in this summary and not otherwise defined have the meanings given in the Common Definitions Schedule.

The product journey is summarised below:

1. **Invoice origination** – Originator mints an invoice obligation for AUD 100 owed by the payer and secures payer acceptance, creating a transferable NFT that embodies the receivable.
2. **Tokenised issuance** – Issuer creates a suite of NFTs: `investment_token` (rights to issuer account distributions), `credit_token` (credit line access), and `collateral_token` (rights over collateral account assets). These instruments represent the capital stack supporting the transaction.
3. **Membership gating** – Each obligation-backed NFT is linked to the appropriate Issuer or Collateral group membership, ensuring that only authorised parties can act on the associated assets.
4. **Investor funding** – Investor deposits AUD 1,000 and engages in a swap with the issuer, exchanging cash for the `investment_token` and locking in exposure to issuer-managed distributions.
5. **Collateral alignment** – Issuer and collateral group complete a swap that pairs the credit facility with the collateral NFT, aligning credit support with pledged collateral.
6. **Capital deployment** – Originator factors the invoice at 90% of face value. A composed operation both settles the swap (disbursing AUD 90) and transfers ownership of the invoice obligation to the collateral group, securing the investor’s position.
7. **Capital call mechanics** – Investor can make instant capital transfers within the issuer group context and confirm receipts, enabling rapid responses to liquidity needs or additional drawdowns.

The structure delivers exposure to tokenised invoice cash flows backed by collateral and issuer credit support, designed to meet the expectations of Australian wholesale investors seeking yield with enhanced transparency and programmable controls.

Investors hold entitlements through whitelisted wallets on the YieldFabric permissioned ledger; distributions and governance actions are executed by smart contracts with auditable on-chain logs. Optional custodial services are available for institutions that prefer delegated key management, subject to separate agreements and security standards.
