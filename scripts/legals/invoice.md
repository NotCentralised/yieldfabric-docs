Invoice receivable originated by the payer and assigned to the investor structure via the `invoice_token`. Capitalised terms used in this summary and not otherwise defined have the meanings given in the Common Definitions Schedule. Key terms:

- **Obligor**: payer undertakes to pay AUD 100 on or before 31 December 2025 to the holder of the NFT.
- **Issuance**: Originator mints the obligation on YieldFabric and payer provides explicit acceptance prior to transfer.
- **Transfer mechanics**: Ownership of the receivable follows the NFT; transfers are executed through platform operations and recorded on-chain.
- **Use in structure**: Post-factoring, the obligation is moved to the collateral group to secure investor capital and distributions.
- **Governing law**: Intended to operate under Australian law, with customary invoice assignment warranties from originator and no set-off or counter-claims permitted by payer.
- **Metadata integrity**: Invoice data and supporting document hashes embedded in the token metadata; any amendments require originator and trustee approval with full audit trail.
- **Dispute handling**: Platform logs capture payer acceptance and subsequent status updates for evidentiary use in enforcement or reconciliation.
