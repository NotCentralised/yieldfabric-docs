The ICT operates as part of the NotCentralised Acacia Trust Structure, which also includes:

⸻

17. Conflicts of Interest

The Investment Manager and Platform Operator may be related entities.

	•	fair dealing between trusts;

19. Historical and Market Context

The Trust structure draws on securitisation principles proven through prior crises — notably the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, where opaque receivable and mortgage structures amplified contagion.

By contrast, the Acacia Trusts’ tokenised and transparent architecture provides:
	•	real-time visibility of underlying assets,
	•	deterministic settlement,
	•	automated risk and yield reporting.

History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes: this design mitigates the very opacity and timing mismatches that once destabilised markets, offering a modern, resilient infrastructure for real-world assets.
