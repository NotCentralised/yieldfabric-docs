6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR-Aligned)

Where applicable under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or UK GDPR, processing is based on:
	•	contractual necessity (to perform investor or trust agreements);
	•	legal obligations (AML/CTF, taxation, corporate law);
	•	legitimate interests (platform security, analytics, fraud prevention); or
	•	explicit consent (for marketing or optional data processing).

⸻

7. Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose information to:
	•	Trustees, custodians, and auditors of the Acacia Trusts;
	•	Regulators and government authorities, including ASIC, AUSTRAC, ATO, and law enforcement;
	•	Service providers (KYC vendors, IT hosts, legal advisors, blockchain analytics firms);
	•	Counterparties to transactions, where required for verification;
	•	Overseas recipients, including cloud infrastructure providers in Australia, Singapore, the United States, and the European Union.

Where cross-border disclosure occurs, we ensure that recipients are subject to comparable privacy protections (APP 8.1 compliance or contractual safeguards).

⸻

8. Data Security and Storage

We store data securely using a combination of:
	•	encrypted databases and secured Australian cloud services;
	•	role-based access controls and audit logs;
	•	cryptographic wallet-based authentication; and
	•	immutable blockchain records for verification and traceability.

Immutable Ledger Data

Because blockchain data cannot be deleted or altered, we implement “tombstoning” and pointer redirection techniques to ensure that personal identifiers are masked or replaced with pseudonymous hashes upon request or expiry.

⸻

9. Data Retention

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for:
	•	trust and investor record-keeping obligations (typically 7 years);
	•	AML/CTF reporting (7 years post-relationship);
	•	audit and compliance requirements.

Blockchain transaction data may persist indefinitely but is pseudonymised.

⸻

10. Access, Correction, and Portability Rights

You have the right to:
	•	access the personal information we hold about you;
	•	request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information;
	•	request a digital copy of your data in a portable format (where feasible);
	•	object to certain processing (e.g., marketing).

Requests can be made by emailing privacy@notcentralised.com.au.
We aim to respond within 30 days, in accordance with APP 12 and 13.

⸻

11. Cross-Border Transfers

When transferring data outside Australia, we:
	•	ensure that the receiving country has comparable privacy protections;
	•	apply encryption and contractual obligations; and
	•	maintain mirrored storage within Australia where feasible.

⸻

12. Cookies, Analytics, and Device Data

The Platform may use cookies and telemetry to:
	•	authenticate user sessions;
	•	monitor performance and system integrity;
	•	enhance user experience and detect anomalies.

You can disable cookies, but some Platform functions may be limited.

⸻

13. Automated Decision-Making

Smart contracts automatically execute pre-defined operations (e.g., yield distribution, token transfers) without human intervention.
These automated processes are governed by the Trust Deed and do not involve profiling or credit scoring beyond disclosed eligibility checks.

⸻

14. Data Breaches

If a data breach occurs that is likely to cause serious harm, we will:
	•	notify affected individuals;
	•	report the breach to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC); and
	•	publish an incident summary via wallet or platform notification.

⸻

15. Third-Party Links and Integrations

Our Platform may link to external services (custodians, KYC providers, oracles).
We are not responsible for their privacy practices and recommend reviewing their privacy policies before use.
